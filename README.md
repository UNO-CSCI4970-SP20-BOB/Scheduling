# Scheduling
Scheduling and Forecasting Build

Example scheduling system that utilizes a constraint based programming system to schedule out sample workers for a given period of time.

(Included is an example sales forecasting module, this exists as a working example in case we move towards forecasting event demand.)

This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) which aims to work out the feasibility of the core optimization tasks that our project is designed for.

The Scheduler outputs a JSON file that holds info for optimized schedules based on the constraints given.

The following rollout will aim to prove out a seasonal cadence for the forecasting system, along with a JSON file of recommendations, which would be integrated with our Spring system.

In order to run the scheduling system, ensure the appropriate modules and libraries are hosted on your system.

Then run Scheduler.py for the Scheduler or Mainpy for the forecasting PoC.
