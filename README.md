# Scheduling
Scheduling and Forecasting Build

Example scheduling system that utilizes a constraint based programming system to schedule out sample workers for a given period of time.

(Included is an example sales forecasting module, this exists as a working example in case we move towards forecasting event demand.)


This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) which aims to work out the feasibility of the core optimization tasks that our project is designed for.

The following rollout will aim to prove out a seasonal cadence for the forecasting system.

In order to run the scheduling system, ensure the appropriate modules and libraries are hosted on your system.

Then run the Scheduler file or the Forecasting files for each PoC.
